A virtual queuing system with SMS notifications, built with FastAPI and React.

## Features

- üé´ Virtual queue management
- üì± SMS notifications when it's your turn
- üë§ User authentication for queue administrators
- üîê JWT-based authentication
- üìä Real-time queue status
- üéØ RESTful API

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic
- **Authentication**: JWT with OAuth2
- **Database**: SQLite (dev), PostgreSQL (prod)
- **SMS**: Twilio
- **Package Management**: UV
- **Linting/Formatting**: Ruff
- **Type Checking**: mypy

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- UV package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd queue
```

2. Install UV (if not already installed):
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
uv sync --dev
```

4. Copy environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

5. Edit `.env` with your configuration

### SMS Configuration

By default, the app uses a mock SMS provider in development that logs messages to the console. To use Twilio in production:

1. Set `ENVIRONMENT=production` in `.env`
2. Add your Twilio credentials:
   - `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`
   - `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`
   - `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`

The mock provider is perfect for testing without incurring SMS costs.

### Running the Server

```bash
python run.py
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`
API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`
